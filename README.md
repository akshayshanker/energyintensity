World and U.S. energy intensity has declined over the past century.
Because the decline in energy intensity has persisted through periods
of stagnating or even falling energy prices, energy economists have
suspected factors related to the growth process, independent of prices,
have played a role in historical energy efficiency improvements. In this
paper, we study the future potential of non-price improvements in energy
efficiency using directed technical change theory. We incorporate
labor and energy augmenting technical change in a Neo-Schumpeterian
endogenous growth model; the model allows us to study the economic
trade-offs innovating firms make as they decide whether to pursue energy
or non-energy augmenting innovation. We compare two innovation
regimes, one with strong scale effects, where the existing body of
knowledge enhances the productivity of research and one without scale
effects. Our main finding is that whether or not non-price energy efficiency
improvements continue in the future depends on the extent to
which labor augmenting innovation crowds out energy augmenting innovation,
and in the regime with scale effects, energy augmenting innovation
eventually declines to zero. By contrast in the regime without
scale effects, energy innovation continues albeit at a slower rate than
non-energy innovation.
